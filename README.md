## Guide
- The [Analyses](./analyses/) folder contains data and codes needed to compute the analyses.
  
  - The codes used to manage and format the plasmid sequences can be found within the [data_collection](./analyses/data_collection.md) section.
 
  - To inspect the codes and programs used to annotate plasmids, to search for Biosynthetic Gene Clusters, and to analyze their diversity, go to the [plasmids_annotation](./analyses/plasmids_annotation.md) section. This section details many diverse annotation steps.

- To inspect the codes used for the generation of graphics and figures, go to the [Figures](./Figures/figures.md) section. This folder also includes the [Source Data](./Figures/Source_data) needed to create each graphic.
